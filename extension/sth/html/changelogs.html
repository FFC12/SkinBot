    <p>(1) SteamLvlUp (Gems) - prices in the main website currency called "Gems" / SteamLvlUp - prices in your selected
      currency.</p>
    <p>(2) These prices are being collected from the Steam marketplace in USD currency and converted to your selected
      currency. They may differ from the real price because all regional prices are different, but its still close to
      the market prices. (Its hard to collect ~116000 prices from every regional marketplace, thats why its a kind of
      placeholder, please use that to compare prices, but not as a standard-etalon price, we are still looking into the
      ability to get all regional prices).</p>

      <li>Fixed: Your wishlist games highlight function not working in some cases when user is switching pages in Steam
        store.
      </li>
      <li>Removed: CSGOFAST prices for the following games - H1Z1, Rust, Just Survive, Team Fortress 2. Items from these
        games are temporarily not acceptable on this website.
      </li>
      <li>Removed: OPSKINS prices (for all the games) due to their recent conflict with Valve after which OPSKINS prices
        are not real and actual anymore.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>* This BETA service is located on the "Badges" page. The purpose of the function is to level up you profile with
      just a few clicks with the level you would choose by searching the cheapest card sets on the market.
    <ol>
      <li>Select the desired level.</li>
      <li>Check how much sets you need to level up.</li>
      <li>Press "LEVEL UP!" button.</li>
      <li>Check how much it will cost you with the lowest priced card sets on the market.</li>
      <li>BAM! You got the cheapest items to level up your profile and all that was made just by few clicks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please consider that this function is in BETA testing mode and will contain more cool stuff later.</p>
    <p>Please consider that Steam allows us to display and use only 100 card order on 1 page. So, for example, if you
      will need a 1000 card order to level up your profile, this feature will open 10 browser windows with all of the
      cards (sets).</p>
    </p>
    <p>** It will be displayed on the same spot where you can see the Float from CS:GO.</p>
    <p>*** Now you will be able to check how much your item worth in BP before buying and trade your items for the PUBG
      crates much easier by searching the cheapest ones on market.</p>

    <p>(1) These prices are gathered from our cache of steam requests and are quite accurate. However, they may differ
      from
      the "requested" prices a bit. This feature was made to lower the requests amount made to Steam and its being
      informative
      only so you can compare prices with the different sites & Steam. Don't worry about the freshness of the prices
      which
      are being requested in the mass listing function. They will be fresh and new anyways.</p>
    <p>(2) P.S. Please let us know if you want us to make an external service with this kind of info (if it was more
      comfortable
      to use).</p>
